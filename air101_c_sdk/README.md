## Download Toolchains

* https://occ.t-head.cn/community/download
* You need to register an account for download
* 导航->工具->工具链-800系列->(For now, it is V3.10.29)
* Download according to your OS version, e.g. for Ubuntu20.04, download csky-elfabiv2-tools-x86_64-minilibc-yyyymmdd.tar.gz
* If you can not download from above link, try
   * https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Mp-oHNM3k4Hb8vEybv8pZg code:vw42
   * https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNmtn1gsqWq2641vJJrLbBfENCKHT4xpiH5cdaPnkxzqd
   * https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNmtn1gsqWq2641vJJrLbBfENCKHT4xpiH5cdaPnkxzqd

## Installation

Extract the toolchains to proper folder -- be careful that the tar ball use `./` as top level path, move it to a seperate folder or specify a target folder for the uncompressing.
```bash
mkdir csky-elfabiv2-tools-x86_64-minilibc-20210423
tar xvf csky-elfabiv2-tools-x86_64-minilibc-20210423.tar.gz  -C csky-elfabiv2-tools-x86_64-minilibc-20210423/
```
Then move it to somewhere, e.g. /opt/toolchains, set it read-only to normal users
```bash
cd /opt/toolchains/
sudo mv ~/Download/csky-elfabiv2-tools-x86_64-minilibc-20210423/ .
sudo chown -R root:root csky-elfabiv2-tools-x86_64-minilibc-20210423/
```
You don't need to add it to the system PATH variable.

## Building

Checkout this project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thinkoco/air101_sdk.git
```

Run menuconfig, configurate the toolchains path
```bash
cd wm-sdk-w806
make menuconfig
```

In menuconfig, navigate to `Toolchain Configuration`, In the second line "the toolchain path", input the absolute path of the toolchains executables, e.g.
```
/opt/toolchains/csky-elfabiv2-tools-x86_64-minilibc-20210423/bin/
```
Leave other settings unchanged, save and exit menuconfig.

Then build the project
```bash
make
```

### More Building Options

* UART0 `printf()` output  
  In /include/arch/xt804/csi_config.h, option `USE_UART0_PRINT` controls whether use UART0 to send `printf()` output, it is turned on by default. Note: This feature will occupy UART0, if any other devices are going to communicate with UART0, please turn it off.
* Hands-free download  
  In /include/arch/xt804/csi_config.h, option `USE_UART0_AUTO_DL` controls enable/disable automatic download, it is turned off by default. When it is enabled, download tool will reset the board automatically before the downloading. Option `USE_UART0_PRINT` should be enabled to make this work.

## Download To Development Board

Connect the development board to PC, get the USB port name by commands `dmesg`, `lsusb` and `ls /dev/tty*`.

Run menuconfig to set the download port
```bash
cd wm-sdk-w806
make menuconfig
```
In menuconfig, navigate to `Download Configuration`
* Download port: Input the USB port name, e.g. `ttyUSB0`;
* Down rate: Input the UART baud rate, the higher rate the higher download speed. The availabe options are `115200`, `460800`, `921600`, `1000000` and `2000000`.

Then save and exit menuconfig, download the hex file to development board
```bash
make flash
```

Press the `Reset` key to start the downloading. If previously downloaded hex was built with `USE_UART0_AUTO_DL` enabled, the board will start downloading automatically.

# Problems

1. Download Failed  
When it shows `can not open serial make: *** [tools/w806/rules.mk:158: flash] Error 255`, check if any other applications are occupying the USB port, if yes, close it and retry.
2. Delay function failed in FreeRTOS  
In /include/arch/xt804/csi_config.h, please comment out `#define CONFIG_KERNEL_NONE 1`
3. Hex is not updated  
If the compilation doesn't reflect your code changes, please clean the workspace with`make clean` or `make distclean`
4. Auto-reset failed  
In some cases the auto-reset may fail, you need to press the Reset key to reset the board manually.
